# modularisation-poc
This repo contains a PoC multi module app relying on dagger for dependecy injection. Please check folder One. It's where the magic happens.

TL;DR: By relying on subcomponents we can have independent feature modules that get their dagger subtree generated at runtime. 
Although not the goal, this approach is scalable enough that instant apps can be achieved with minimum effort.

I will document this better.
